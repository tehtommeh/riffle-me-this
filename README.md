## ✨ What is this?

Ever wondered what happens mathematically when you shuffle a deck of cards? This interactive web application lets you explore 11+ different shuffling algorithms and visualize their patterns in real-time. From the elegant mathematics of perfect Faro shuffles to the chaotic beauty of monkey shuffles, discover how each technique creates unique cycles and frequency patterns.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🔀 **11+ Shuffling Algorithms**
- **Riffle Shuffle**: The classic riffle with perfect/imperfect variations
- **Faro Shuffle**: Mathematically perfect in-shuffle and out-shuffle
- **Alternating Shuffles**: Top/bottom placement variations
- **Spiral Shuffle**: Using Fibonacci, prime numbers, or powers of 2
- **And many more**: Cut, Pile, Weave, Monkey, Fisherman, and Reverse Sections

### 📊 **Multiple Visualization Types**
- **Waveform**: Audio-visualizer style frequency display
- **Card Scatter**: Constellation plots showing card positions
- **Mandala**: Beautiful circular patterns revealing shuffle symmetries
- **Particle System**: Physics-based animated card movements
- **DFT Analysis**: Discrete Fourier Transform frequency spectrum analysis

### 🎮 **Interactive Controls**
- Customizable deck sizes (cards per suit, number of suits)
- Algorithm-specific parameters (cut positions, pile counts, etc.)
- Step-by-step playback with speed controls
- Real-time visualization switching
- Detailed tooltips and information panels

### 📈 **Mathematical Analysis**
- Cycle detection (when does the deck return to original order?)
- Frequency domain analysis showing periodic patterns
- Position tracking with chord diagrams
- Individual suit analysis alongside full deck patterns

## 🎧 Inspired by "A Problem Squared"

This project was created after listening to Matt Parker and Bec Hill explore the fascinating world of card shuffling mathematics on their brilliant podcast. Their insightful discussion of how different shuffling techniques create mathematical patterns inspired this interactive visualization.
